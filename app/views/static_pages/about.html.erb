      The Cooperative Gallery 213 has been a pioneering presence on State Street,
      now the hub of the arts renaissance in Binghamton.
      Cooperative Gallery 213 is a popular stop on the highly successful
      First Friday Art Walks which occur monthly from 3 to 9 pm.
      The gallery is open every Friday 3-6 pm, every
